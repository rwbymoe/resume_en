# Cover Letter
Dear Hiring Manager,

I am Zhu Zhen, graduated from China Jiliang University, with 5 years of solid frontend development experience. I am proficient in JavaScript(ES6+), Vue2, and Vue3, and I have expertise in various frontend technologies. I am very interested in the position of Senior Frontend Developer.

I have been working full-time offline in China until now, and I thought, since all the work of a frontend developer can be done online, why limit myself to local companies? Therefore, I have decided to explore remote work opportunities.

Prior to this, I have been responsible for numerous frontend projects at well-known companies and hold high standards for code quality. I possess the ability to develop large and complex Vue.js projects.

I am very easy to get along with, and you can ask me any questions, mailto:heureka@foxmail.com. I hope to join your company and contribute to your team.

Thank you for reading my cover letter, and I look forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely, 

Zhu Zhen 2023/09
